# 🚀 DevOps Notes – Linux & Cloud Hands-on Practice

This repository contains my structured hands-on practice as part of my DevOps learning journey.  
It includes Linux fundamentals, troubleshooting, user & group management, networking concepts, storage management (LVM), and cloud server setup using AWS EC2.

The goal of this repository is to build strong practical foundations through daily implementation rather than only theoretical study.

# 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized day-wise:

- Day 01–03 → Linux basics & command practice  
- Day 04–05 → Process monitoring & systemd troubleshooting  
- Day 06–11 → File operations, permissions, ownership & user/group management  
- Day 12 → Revision & reflection  
- Day 13 → LVM (Logical Volume Management)  
- Day 15 → Networking fundamentals (DNS, IP, CIDR, Ports)  
- Cloud Setup → EC2, Nginx, Docker & Web deployment  

Each folder contains markdown documentation of commands used, observations, and what I learned.

# 🧠 My Approach

- Understand the concept  
- Implement it hands-on  
- Observe real outputs  
- Document what worked  
- Document what failed  
- Reflect and improve  

This repository represents practical experimentation similar to real production troubleshooting scenarios.
